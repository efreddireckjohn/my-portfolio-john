    <p style="font-size: 30px;color: beige;">Understand the things I say<br>
        Don't turn away from me<br>
        'Cause I spent half my life out there<br>
        You wouldn't disagree<br>
        <br>
        D'you see me?<br>
        D'you see?<br>
        Do you like me?<br>
       Do you like me standing there?<br>
        D'you notice?<br>
        D'you know?<br>
        Do you see me?<br>
        Do you see me?<br>
        Does anyone care?<br>
        <br>
        Unhappiness<br>
        Where's when I was young<br>
        And we didn't give a damn<br>
        'Cause we were raised<br>
        To see life as fun<br>
        And take it if we can<br>
        <br>
        My mother<br>
        My mother she'd hold me<br>
        She'd hold me<br>
        When I was out there<br>
        My father<br>
        My father he liked me<br>
        Oh, he liked me<br>
        Does anyone care?<br>
        <br>
        Understand what I've become<br>
        It wasn't my design<br>
        And people everywhere think<br>
        Something better than I am<br>
        <br>
        I miss you<br>
        I miss 'cause I liked it<br>
        'Cause I liked it<br>
        When I was out there<br>
        D'you know this?<br>
        D'you know?<br>
        You did not find me<br>
        You did not find<br>
        Does anyone care?<br>
        <br>
        Unhappiness<br>
        Where's when I was young<br>
        And we didn't give a damn<br>
        'Cause we were raised<br>
        To see life as fun<br>

        <br>
        Does anyone care?<br>
        Does anyone care?<br>
        Does anyone care?<br>
